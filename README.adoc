A CLI app which establishes a connection to a private Google Cloud SQL instance and port-forwards it to a local machine.

Connection is established by running a Google Cloud SQL Auth Proxy pod in a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster which runs in the same VPC network as the private Cloud SQL instance. Connection is then port-forwarded to the local machine, where a user can connect to the instance on localhost. **Corresponding workload identity has to be configured in the cluster, with service account which has Cloud SQL Client role on the given SQL instance.** Configurations in the app can be saved for practical future usage.

The app relies on local `gcloud` and `kubectl` commands which have to be configured and authenticated with the proper Google Cloud user and GKE Kubernetes cluster.

* Authenticate to Google Cloud: `gcloud auth login`
* Get GKE cluster credentials: `gcloud container clusters get-credentials`
* https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity[Configure workload identity] in GKE namespace(s) and assign _Cloud SQL Client_ role in IAM for Cloud SQL instances that you want to use
* Enable Cloud SQL Admin API for project(s) that host Cloud SQL instances that you want to use: `gcloud services enable sqladmin.googleapis.com --project=$PROJECT`

=== Run
[source,bash]
----
# Help
